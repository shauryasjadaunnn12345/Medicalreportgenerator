    <h2 class="h1class">What is OCD (Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder)?</h2>
    <p>Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder (OCD) is a common but often misunderstood mental health condition. It involves persistent, intrusive thoughts (obsessions) and repetitive actions or rituals (compulsions) that individuals feel driven to perform. These patterns can become disruptive and interfere with daily life, relationships, and work or school performance.</p>
    <p>OCD symptoms can manifest in many forms, including cleanliness rituals, fear of harm, checking behaviors, or mental compulsions. Identifying early signs of OCD is the first step to gaining control and finding support.</p>
